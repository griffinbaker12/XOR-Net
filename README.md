# What is this?
This project implements a simple neural network to solve the XOR problem. It demonstrates how a basic multi-layer perceptron can learn to classify non-linearly separable data.

# Installation
1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/griffinbaker12/XOR-Net.git
cd XOR-Net
```

2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
Run the main script:

```
python net.py
```

This will:
1) initialize the neural network
2) train the network on the XOR problem 
3) print and graph final charts
